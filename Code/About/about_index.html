				Underwater Hockey was invented in 1954 by the Southsea Sub-Aquatic Club in Portsmouth, England. Originally it was called "octopush" (and still known by the name in the United Kingdom) because each team had 8 players, a stick similar similar to a shuffleboard stick, called a "pusher", and an uncoated lead puck called a "squid".  Underwater Hockey is very popular in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zeeland, and South Africa.

				There are two world governing bodies for Underwater Hockey: Confederation Mondiale Activities Sub-aquatics (CMAS) is the European governing body which organizes international competitions known as the World Games which also include finswimming and free-diving. The first World Games were held in Bari, Italy in 2007. The World governing body is the World AquaChallenge Association (WAA) which puts on the official World Championships; the most recent championship was held in Perth, Western Australia.

				The official governing body of underwater hockey in the United States is the Underwater Society of America (USOA). They provide support and national recognition for Underwater Hockey as well as Underwater Rugby, Fin Swimming, and other Underwater diving sports. More information on USOA can be found <a href="http://www.underwater-society.org/">here</a>.

				Underwater Hockey is a fast paced game played on the bottom of a 6-8 feet pool. Each team has 6 players and the players wear fins, a mask, snorkel, cap with ear guards, and a glove. The sticks that are used are very short, about 1 foot long, and the puck is around 3 pounds and covered in a hard plastic case. 
			</p>
			<p id="rules">
				Play strategy is similar to ice hockey or soccer, there are a number of different formations and because players hold their breath while playing, team work is crucial to scoring. The rules are "non-contact", players cannot hold off other players with their free arm, making the game equal across all ages and genders. The official rules can be found <a href="http://www.underwater-society.org/uwhockey.html">here</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Previous swimming experience is <b><u>not necessary</b></u>, that's what the fins are for! Some of the best players did not swim before they joined the team.
